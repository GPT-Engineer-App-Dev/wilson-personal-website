# wilson-personal-website

Create a home page for a personal website about Woodrow Wilson. 

The page should include:
- A header with "Woodrow Wilson" as the page title 
- A photo of Woodrow Wilson
- A one paragraph biography summarizing who he was (28th U.S. President, years in office, key facts)
- Navigation menu items for "Home", "Biography", "Presidency", "Gallery", "Resources" (but don't create those pages yet)
- Footer with credit to the website author

Use a simple, classic design that evokes the early 20th century time period. The content should inform visitors about who Woodrow Wilson was but remain brief, as there will be additional pages with more details.
